# Differential Drive

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in Progress

This is a personal learning project and is not actively maintained beyond my own educational use. I might add small updates or improvements over time, but the main goal was to experiment and document results.

I'm not putting much effort into designing a clean 3D model for the chassis either. I uploaded the STL files and a basic layout, but the focus of the project is on control software and experimentation, not mechanical design.

## ü§ñ Introduction

I created this simple differential drive platform to help me explore foundational concepts in mobile robotics, control, and especially the PID algorithm.

The goal of the project was to build a robot that is capable of maintaining the issued velocity on both wheels using a PID controller. No actuator is the same in reality and moving in a straight line in an open loop is impossible. After a short transient phase (dependent on how well the PID parameters are tuned) the robot is able to follow desired velocity commands with good precision.

## ü§ù Contribution

This is primarily a personal learning project, so I don‚Äôt expect or actively encourage contributions. However, if you‚Äôre curious or working on something similar, feel free to open an issue or get in touch.
